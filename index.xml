      <description>&amp;ldquo;Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai&amp;rdquo; probably the only statement which can sum up what we are, but apart from all the various roles you play in my life,i guess a thing which is common in all of that is that YOU&amp;rsquo;RE SPECIAL TO ME, Also ik I don&amp;rsquo;t praise you a lot but Cmon let&amp;rsquo;s face it you can&amp;rsquo;t compete with me,but to best describe you in three words nothing comes to my mind other than ( chal na nikal).</description>
